# Binary Search Tree Operations Lab 🌳💻

Welcome to the Binary Search Tree Operations Lab! This Java program showcases various operations on a binary search tree (BST) and provides a hands-on experience with tree manipulation.

## Explore the Lab 👀 
The program demonstrates essential BST operations, including insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

## Operations Showcase 🎬
1. **Printing Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder:**
   - Witness the BST in different traversal orders.

2. **Search Level:**
   - Check the level of specific items in the BST.

3. **Leaf Nodes:**
   - Find the number of leaf nodes in the BST.
     
4. **Full Nodes:**
   - Discover the number of nodes with both left and right children.

5. **Tree Height:**
   - Determine the height of the BST.

6. **Sum of Values:**
   - Calculate the sum of values in the binary tree.

7. **Sum of Values:**
   - Add or delete nodes, and observe the changes in the BST structure.
